Widening Conversion Hierarchy:
	byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
Explicit Type Casting:
	i.conversion of larger datatype to smaller datatype
	ii.Explicit type casting, also known as narrowing conversion.
Narrowing conversion Hierarchy:
	double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
Implicit (Automatic) Type Conversion: 
	i.conversion of smaller datatype to larger datatype
	ii.Implicit type conversion is also known as widening conversion.
